**2. Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
This file is the Python equivalent of `package.json`. It lists all the libraries that someone else would need to install to run your project.

* Open your terminal in your project folder.
* Make sure your virtual environment is active (you should see `(venv)` at the start of your prompt).
* Run this single command:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
This command will automatically create a `requirements.txt` file with all the necessary libraries listed.

### Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

Now, you just need to run the standard Git commands in your terminal.

1.  **Initialize Git:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all your files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Make your first commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Add all project files and models"
    ```

4.  **Connect your local folder to your GitHub repository:**
    Go to the GitHub page for your new repository and copy the URL. It will look something like `https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Agriculture-WebApp.git`.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    ```

5.  **Rename the main branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

6.  **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After you run these commands, refresh your GitHub page. You will see all your project files there!

### Final Recommendation: Add a Professional README

A `README` file is the front page of your project on GitHub. It's the first thing your professor will see. I have created a professional `README.md` file for you that explains the project, its features, and how to run it.

You can copy the content of this file, create a `README.md` file in your project folder, and paste it in. After you do that, you can add and push it to GitHub with these commands:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add project README"
git push

Congratulations on completing this fantastic project!
