Smart Agriculture AssistantThis web application is a comprehensive tool designed to assist farmers by leveraging the power of AI and data. It provides three core features: AI-powered crop recommendation, real-time plant disease detection, and weed identification from images.FeaturesCrop Recommendation: Recommends the best crop to plant based on the user's local soil and weather conditions. The model is a RandomForestClassifier trained on historical agricultural data for various states in India.Disease Detection: Identifies 38 different types of plant diseases from an uploaded image of a plant leaf. This feature uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.Weed Detection: Identifies 12 different types of common weeds and crop seedlings from an uploaded image. This also uses a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras.Live Market Prices: Fetches recent commodity prices for a selected state to provide economic context for farming decisions.Fertilizer Calculator: Recommends the amount of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) needed for a specific crop based on current soil nutrient levels.Tech StackBackend: Python, FlaskMachine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PandasFrontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScriptSetup and InstallationClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
