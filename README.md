# Smart Agriculture Assistant

This web application is a comprehensive tool designed to assist farmers by leveraging the power of AI and data. It provides three core features: AI-powered crop recommendation, real-time plant disease detection, and weed identification from images.

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation**: Recommends the best crop to plant based on the user's local soil and weather conditions. The model is a RandomForestClassifier trained on historical agricultural data for various states in India.
- **Disease Detection**: Identifies 38 different types of plant diseases from an uploaded image of a plant leaf. This feature uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Weed Detection**: Identifies 12 different types of common weeds and crop seedlings from an uploaded image. This also uses a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Live Market Prices**: Fetches recent commodity prices for a selected state to provide economic context for farming decisions.
- **Fertilizer Calculator**: Recommends the amount of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) needed for a specific crop based on current soil nutrient levels.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design with dark mode support

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Smart-Agriculture-WebApp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

**For Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
